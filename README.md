# Vr-Game
Vr game made in unity for the Quest 2.

The game will throw projectiles at you at intervals, which you can cut out of the air using projectiles fired from a sword

To use the sword hold the trigger and swing it. This will create a blade like projectile in the shape of your swing that will travel forward and cut objects in its path.

The sword also comes with a sheathe, which you can also pick up. Pulling the trigger on your controller while holding the sheathe will slow time, but will deplete energy as indicated by a bar on the sheathe. When the energy runs out, or when you release the trigger time will flow normally again
